Egyptian Delta Land Use Change Interactive Platform
Overview
This project is an interactive web platform designed to help users seamlessly explore, compare, and analyze land use changes across the Egyptian Delta and southern reclamation zones between 2000 and 2020. The application integrates various GIS and remote sensing techniques to visually demonstrate how agriculture, urban growth, and water bodies have transformed over time.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface:
A clean, intuitive website design that allows users to navigate easily between different datasets and map views.
Swipe-Enabled Interactive Maps:
Compare land use changes side-by-side using a swipe tool that lets users visually assess differences between two years at the governorate level.
Concise Trend Summaries:
Informative pop-ups and dashboard panels provide quick insights into significant land cover and environmental changes.
Integrated Story Maps:
Narrative-driven maps explain the context and implications behind observed changes.
Interactive Dashboards:
Dynamic charts and statistics offer in-depth data exploration and facilitate research.
Feedback Portal:
A Survey123-based form is embedded to gather user input, enhancing the platformâ€™s utility and user experience.

Procedures
- Data Collection & Preprocessing:- Acquired satellite imagery (2000 and 2020) for focus areas (Delta, Toshka, East Oweinat, Lakes such as Burullus, Idku, Manzala).
- Preprocessed imagery and performed land cover classification using ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS Pro.
- Change Detection & Analysis:- Conducted change detection analyses, extracting statistics on area changes and percentages, then organized these in Excel.
- Map Production & Web Integration:- Created thematic maps for different years in ArcGIS Pro, published those to ArcGIS Online or through GeoServer, and built an interactive website embedding maps using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and Leaflet.js.
- Interactive Tools & Visualization:- Implemented swipe comparison tools, interactive dashboards, and story maps to deliver both macro and micro-level insights into land use trends.
- Integrated a feedback mechanism to collect user recommendations.
